ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a Free and Open-Source developer currently living in India, and go by the nickname **amustaque97** on most platforms.

My interests are mainly in software development, but I dabble around security related topics.
I have contributed to a several Open-Source projects, such as [Jetpack](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pulls/amustaque97), [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pulls/amustaque97) and [Datree](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/pulls/amustaque97)

These days I work as a developer in an IT security company.

You can [report](https://github.com/amustaque97/amustaque97.github.io/issues/new/choose) if there is an broken link(s) or somethings else.
