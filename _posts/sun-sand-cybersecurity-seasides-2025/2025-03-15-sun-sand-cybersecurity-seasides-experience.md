After a long hiatus from travel, I finally made my way to Goa in 2025 to attend the *Seasides* security conference. The last time I traveled was in 2019, and it felt incredible to get back out there. It was an experience I won’t forget, and attending *Seasides* made it even more special. For those who aren’t familiar with it, *Seasides* is a community-driven event that blends talks, workshops, villages, and parties, making it an exciting and dynamic conference for everyone involved.

I traveled with my office colleagues, and we were there to represent our company at the event. Our booth was set up with a purpose – to encourage attendees to participate in the Capture The Flag (CTF) competition. The winner would take home an Apple AirPod 4, which added an element of fun and competition. It was a four-day event, and each day was filled with new experiences, valuable lessons, and plenty of networking.

### The Journey to Goa

Arriving in Goa, I could feel the excitement building up. The weather was definitely intense during the day—unbearably hot—but in the evening, the cool breeze made it all worthwhile. The day we reached, it was already evening, and a few colleagues who had been to Goa before suggested we grab a bite at *Kutumbh*, a well-known place for non-vegetarian food. There, we met up with another colleague who had traveled voluntarily to the conference (not as a company-sponsored trip). He had some friends with him, and it turned out to be a wonderful evening, meeting some new faces and chatting with brilliant security engineers and hackers from all over the world.

### Day One: Settling In and Exploring

The first day was all about registration, collecting our ID badges, T-shirts, and various goodies. The excitement was palpable, and as we headed to the common area, it was clear that this was going to be an event to remember. Our booth was set up with a standee and some branding, and we quickly settled in. In no time, talks and workshops were underway, and I couldn’t resist exploring. I visited several talks and events, soaking in the knowledge and learning from some of the best in the field.

It was fascinating to see the variety of topics covered, from vulnerability management to the latest in ethical hacking techniques. The best part, though, was meeting people from different walks of life and from a variety of companies. The diversity of experience and perspectives was inspiring.

### Networking and Goodies Galore

A highlight of the conference was the amazing opportunity to network with professionals and enthusiasts from around the world. The majority of the audience at *Seasides* was made up of students, as the event is free and community-driven, which made for a lively and energetic atmosphere.

It was also fun to witness the craze for goodies! At every booth, attendees were grabbing T-shirts, mugs, and other custom swag. People were really keen on collecting these items, and our booth was no exception. They would often ask about additional giveaways we might have planned for later on, which created a sense of anticipation and excitement throughout the event. I could see how much people loved these interactions and the little gifts, which made the whole experience even more engaging.

### Workshops, Beaches, and New Friendships

Over the next few days, I made sure to attend as many workshops as possible, each one more enriching than the last. It was a unique opportunity to learn from experts, participate in hands-on activities, and engage in real-time discussions. Simultaneously, the conference vibe was very social, with everyone networking, learning, and enjoying themselves.

After the conference activities each day, my colleagues and I would step out to explore the beautiful city of Goa. We visited two amazing beaches—*Miramar Beach* and *Anjuna Beach*—where we spent time relaxing and taking in the stunning views. It was the perfect balance of work and leisure. The beaches were serene, and the perfect spot to unwind after a day filled with knowledge-sharing and intense discussions.

### Conclusion

In summary, *Seasides 2025* was an unforgettable experience. Not only did I get to dive deep into the world of cybersecurity, but I also got to meet brilliant minds, learn from workshops, and build lasting friendships. Goa's unique energy, combined with the conference’s dynamic atmosphere, made this trip truly memorable. 

I came back not only with a wealth of knowledge but also with cherished memories and new connections that I hope will last for years to come.
