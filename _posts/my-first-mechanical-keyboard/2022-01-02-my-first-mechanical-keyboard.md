Last month, I got my first mechanical keyboard. It is **[Keychron K2 V2](https://keychron.in/product/k2-hot-swappable/)**.

It has been a month I'm using this keyboard for my office and regular use. I'm very much happy with this new keyboard. I enjoy typing on the keyboard and sound is not that much because of red switches.
I have seen many reviews of this keyboard on **youtube** to get a wrist rest because it has some height. In my case I don't see any immediate requirement of wrist rest.

Here are few screenshots of the keyboard:

#### Side View

On the side view, Side port & button are good except last one because I feel like it is kind of soft/smooth and switching on/off bluetooth may cause problem that it won't able to side one side :(
Let's see how it goes!

#### Red switches
Keyboard doesn't create that much of noise. Earlier I was planning to go with the **blue switches** but then I thought sometime it may become annoying because of loud noise. I'm happy with the decision to go ahead with red switches. I suggest to choose red switches if you want low sound. Feedback of the buttons is also good.

#### Other accessories

Other than keyboard I got few accessories like extra keycaps and so on.

Overall, keyboard is good and I strongly feel if you're a guy who type a lot on keyboards then spending money on this is worth.
