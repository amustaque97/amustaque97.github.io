I was going through [Datree](https://github.com/datreeio/datree) project issues and decided to work on [issue#350](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/issues/350).

To give you an overview of the issue is that we are trying to do K8 schema validation and if there are multiple errors then print each error in a separate line. <br>
*In current datree release we are printing multiple errors as a single error statement.*

**Issue with the current way of implementation :(**
It is a bit hard to read and understand the actual error. There could be chances it will confuse user with the similar kind of error message. <br>
Here is an example screenshot:

**If anyone works on this issue how is it going to help?** <br>
Issue is not too technical that will require some sophisticated thought process or algorithm logic. This will help users (including us ðŸ˜…) in better reading and maybe help in some parts of ci/cd execution and validation.


**Investigation:** <br>
After going through the codebase, I found that this is happening because of ```Kubeconform``` we are using in our project.  I have [commented](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/issues/350#issuecomment-1003690411) the same on Github.

After discussing with the maintainers I was able to make the required changes. <br>
Changes are minor and it solves the purpose ðŸ˜Š. You can check out my [PR](https://github.com/datreeio/datree/pull/356) as well. After making changes it will look like this:
